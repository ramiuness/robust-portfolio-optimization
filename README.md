# Robust Portfolio Optimization

This repository provides illustrative code and a demonstration notebook for robust portfolio optimization models including the Mean-Variance, CVaR, and Omega-ratio portfolios, as well as their robust counterparts, inspired by the approaches described in the paper ["Robust optimization approaches for portfolio selection: a comparative analysis"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-021-04177-y). The focus is on sharing coding methodology and results, rather than delivering a complete, production-ready software package.

Robust portfolio optimization refines classical asset allocation by embedding parameter uncertainty directly into the optimization framework. Instead of relying solely on estimated inputsâ€”such as expected returns or risk measuresâ€”it constructs portfolios that remain effective across a predefined set of plausible market conditions. This results in allocations that are explicitly designed to mitigate estimation error and perform reliably under adverse scenarios.

In practical terms, robust optimization:

- Reduces the risk of poor performance due to inaccurate forecasts.

- Leads to more conservative, better diversified allocations.

- Offers strong out-of-sample behavior, especially in volatile or regime-shifting markets.

- Can be tailored through the shape and size of the uncertainty set to reflect different levels of confidence or market views.

I demonstrate that robustness with an elliptic uncertainty set significantly improves Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, CVaR, and Omega ratio, of the allocated portfolio, thus confirming the value of accounting for estimation uncertainty in portfolio design.
	    			    		

## Highlights

- **Demonstration Notebook:**  
  The included Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/robust_portfolio_optimization.ipynb`) illustrates the implementation of key concepts from the referenced paper, and presents the results obtained from applying robust optimization techniques to portfolio selection.
- **Sample Model Code:**  
  Example code files implement three core models (Mean-Variance, Omega-ratio, Robust Omega-ratio) to showcase the coding approach.
- **Educational Resource:**  
  Intended as a resource for researchers, students, and practitioners interested in robust portfolio optimization and quantitative finance.
