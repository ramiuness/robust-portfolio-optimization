# Robust Portfolio Optimization

This repository provides illustrative code and a demonstration notebook for robust portfolio optimization models, inspired by the approaches described in the paper ["Robust optimization approaches for portfolio selection: a comparative analysis"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-021-04177-y). The focus is on sharing coding methodology and results, rather than delivering a complete, production-ready software package.

## Highlights

- **Demonstration Notebook:**  
  The included Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/robust_portfolio_optimization.ipynb`) illustrates the implementation of key concepts from the referenced paper, and presents the results obtained from applying robust optimization techniques to portfolio selection.
- **Sample Model Code:**  
  Example code files implement three core models (Mean-Variance, Omega-ratio, Robust Omega-ratio) to showcase the coding approach.
- **Educational Resource:**  
  Intended as a resource for researchers, students, and practitioners interested in robust portfolio optimization and quantitative finance.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Julia
- **Optimization:** JuMP, HiGhs, Gurobi
- **Statistical Models:** Gaussian Mixture Models
- **Notebook:** Jupyter (for demonstration and results)
- **Backtesting:** Rolling-window methodology

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramiuness/robust-portfolio-optimization.git
    ```
2. Install the required Julia packages (see `Project.toml`):
    ```julia
    ] instantiate
    ```
3. (Optional) Install Gurobi and set up the license if you wish to use it as a solver.


## Usage

- Open the demo notebook in the `notebooks/` directory for an overview of the implementation and results.
- Explore the sample code files in the `src/` or main directory for illustrative model implementations.
- Adjust parameters and experiment with the code to suit your learning or research needs.
